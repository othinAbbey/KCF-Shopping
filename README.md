node_modules/ - Contains the dependencies installed via npm.
src/ - Main directory for your source code.
controllers/ - Controllers handling the application logic.
models/ - Contains the data models or database schema.
routes/ - Defines the route endpoints and their handlers.
services/ - Additional services (business logic, external integrations, etc.).
app.js - The main entry file that creates the Express app, sets up middleware, and starts the server.

README.md - Documentation for the project.
This structure separates concerns and allows for a cleaner and more organized codebase. It's not a mandatory structure; you can adjust it based on your project requirements and personal preferences.

To use this structure:

Create the directories (src, controllers, models, routes, services) and the app.js file in the root directory of your Express project.
Organize your code logic accordingly in the respective folders/files.
Ensure to import and use the necessary modules in your app.js file or wherever you set up your server.
Remember to update your package.json with appropriate scripts and dependencies and ensure that your entry point (usually app.js or index.js) is set correctly.

This structure helps maintain a clean and scalable codebase by separating concerns and keeping related functionalities together. Adjust and expand it as needed based on your project's requirements.
